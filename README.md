# <Prework Webpage Study Guide>

## Description
This project was made as a learning experience as well as a helpful respource. I was super excited to make this project and get hands on experience building simple, actual, online webpages. I built this to get experience in three different coding languages and practice my skills. This project will help me easily access my information on it as well as getting experience using my tools. I learned a great deal from this project. I learned how websites are broken down, what goes on for the visuals, and how they are setup to actually be availible for anyone. Honestly really enjoyed my time making this.
